# Expo CLI Metro Bundler Error: Invariant Violation: View config not found for component

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo CLI and Metro bundler. The error message, "Invariant Violation: View config not found for component...", is not very specific.  This issue often arises when integrating third-party libraries that may have compatibility issues with the current Expo SDK version.

## Bug Description:

The primary issue is an unclear error message from the Metro bundler when attempting to bundle an application using a specific third-party library. This makes it difficult to isolate the exact problem within the library or within the application's codebase.  This bug hampers the development workflow and requires more in-depth investigation.

## Bug Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error message within the Metro bundler console.

## Solution:

The solution involves a careful review of the third-party library's documentation to confirm its compatibility with the current Expo SDK version.  Consider updating Expo to the latest SDK version and updating the third-party library to its newest version.  If issues persist, examining the library's codebase for possible conflicts or bugs might be necessary.
