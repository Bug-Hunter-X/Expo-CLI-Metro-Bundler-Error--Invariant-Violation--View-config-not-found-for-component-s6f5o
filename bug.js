While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler, specifically a "Invariant Violation: View config not found for component..." error. This occurred when using a third-party library that wasn't properly configured or compatible with the current Expo SDK version. The error message was not very helpful in pinpointing the root cause, making debugging difficult.
